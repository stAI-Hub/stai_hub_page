# stAI Hub Marburg

We are a group of students passionate about artificial intelligence, especially interested in its applications for the public good. We are also concerned with reducing existential risks posed by AI. Our group meets regularly to engage in discussions, offers a project-based seminar 'AI-Labâ€™ and participates in various competitions.
